# Code of Conduct

A Code of Conduct (CoC) is a set of guidelines that outline the expected
behaviour of all participants involved in a project. It establishes a framework
of shared values, principles, and expectations that sets the tone for how people
should interact with each other while contributing to the project.

Implementing a CoC is fundamental to help create a safe, welcoming, and
inclusive environment for all contributors. Likewise, a CoC sets a standard for
behaviour that promotes mutual respect, diversity, and inclusivity. By fostering
a sense of community and collaboration, the policies can help attract and retain
contributors, encourage a broader range of perspectives, and enhance the overall
quality of the project.

## Prior Art

Open-source communities have acknowledged the need to create a safe and
inclusive environment for contributors, and the idea of a Code of Conduct (CoC)
has emerged as a widely-used tool for this purpose. The success of CoCs can be
seen in various open-source projects, including Django, Kubernetes and the Linux
kernel, which have successfully implemented CoCs to outline expected behaviour,
provide a framework for conflict resolution, and address violations. These
projects are just a few examples of many more that use common CoC standards like
the Contributor Covenant, Citizen Code of Conduct, Fedora Code of Conduct, and
Apache Code of Conduct, among others.

## Motivation

In order to ensure the success of this project, foster a welcoming and inclusive
environment for all contributors, and promote trust and collaboration in the
community, the WhichLicense organization has opted to implement a Code of
Conduct (CoC).

To guarantee that the ultimately chosen CoC aligns with the project's values and
objectives, a set of minimum requirements has been established. Selecting a CoC
that meets these requirements will result in a secure and respectful environment
for all, creating a thriving and supportive open-source community.

### Goals

The following list of typically included CoC aspects must be satisfied:

- **Statement of Purpose**: The CoC should delineate the goals, values, and
  objectives of the project and the Code of Conduct.
- **Respectful and Inclusive Behaviour**: The CoC should provide clear
  expectations for appropriate language, tone, and treatment of others, ensuring
  a welcoming and inclusive environment.
- **Conflict and Dispute Resolution**: The CoC should establish constructive
  steps for reporting incidents and resolving conflicts respectfully and
  effectively.
- **Violation Consequences**: The CoC should specify the consequences of
  breaching the code, including warnings, temporary or permanent bans, or other
  disciplinary actions.
- **Rule Enforcement**: The CoC should outline who is responsible for enforcing
  the code and how violations will be addressed.

### Non-goals

To prevent any potential confusion during the selection process, it is also
imperative to clearly define what the Code of Conduct should not aim to achieve
or include:

- **Punishing Contributors for Unintentional Mistakes**: A CoC is not designed
  to punish contributors for accidental mistakes. Rather, it aims to guide
  acceptable behaviour and provide a system for managing incidents of
  inappropriate behaviour.
- **Suppressing Free Speech or Dissenting Opinions**: A CoC is not intended to
  stifle free speech or dissenting opinions. Instead, it aims to promote
  respectful and constructive communication, ensuring that all contributors feel
  secure and respected while participating in the project.
- **Creating a Legal Framework for the Project**: A CoC is not meant to
  establish a legal framework for the project. Conversely, it seeks to establish
  shared values, principles, and behavioural expectations that can contribute to
  a positive and productive work environment for all contributors.
- **Resolving All Disputes and Conflicts**: A CoC is not designed to resolve
  every conflict or disagreement within the project. Instead, it intends to
  provide a framework for constructively and respectfully resolving
  inappropriate behaviour.

## Solution Proposal

After conducting a comprehensive evaluation of all the aforementioned Codes of
Conduct (CoCs), the organization has determined that the Contributor Covenant
would be the most appropriate for adoption based on its stated goals.
Additionally, the Contributor Covenant's detailed and concise expectations and
guidelines make it a more suitable choice than alternatives such as the Citizen
Code of Conduct.

### Risks and Mitigations

Implementing and enforcing a CoC in an open-source community presents
challenges, but effective enforcement can be achieved through the following
measures:

- **Clear Communication**: Ensuring all contributors understand the expectations
  for behaviour by effectively communicating the CoC to them.
- **Reporting**: Establishing a straightforward process for reporting incidents,
  addressing violations, and ensuring everyone knows how to report incidents and
  what to expect during the reporting and investigation process.
- **Consistency**: Specifying a transparent and consistent process for
  addressing violations and ensuring that all violations are addressed promptly
  and fairly.
- **Transparency**: Maintaining transparency throughout the enforcement process
  and communicating clearly with all parties involved about the outcome of the
  investigation and any disciplinary action.

## Alternatives

There are various alternatives to a Code of Conduct, such as Social Contracts,
Community Guidelines, and Statements of Values. These options also aim to
establish guidelines for acceptable behaviour within a community and set
expectations for contributors. However, they may differ significantly in their
scope, language, or implementation.

Ultimately, the open-source community is familiar with the concept of a CoC, so
deviating from it as a well-established standard without cause seems
counterintuitive.

## Potential Future Developments

If the project and organization team grows, it may be necessary to introduce
additional mitigations to prevent divergent enforcement approaches or setbacks
in effectiveness:

- **Training**: Providing training to community leaders and moderators on how to
  effectively enforce the CoC and ensuring that they understand their
  responsibilities and have the necessary support to enforce it.
